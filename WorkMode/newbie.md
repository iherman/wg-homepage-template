# Welcome to the DID Working Group
{: .no_toc}

This document includes some information for new members ("*Newbies*") of the DID Working Group (DID WG).

Members of the WG, **especially new members** are encouraged to help maintain this document.

* TOC
{:toc}

The Working Group’s home page is: [https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/](https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/). Looking at the left and right column of the page gives you lots of further information. Especially, the group's *Work Mode* is described in the [*WorkMode*](index) document and it includes information about how the WG operates, including links to the WG's various resources.

## Meetings

The group holds a weekly teleconference; see [the separate page](../Meetings/) for the timing and the dial-in details.

## GitHub

The group operates mostly on [GitHub](index#github): that is where the specifications are developed, where issues are discussed. Even these pages are in a GitHub repository (look at the bottom for the reference). It is therefore important to familiarize yourself, at least at a basic level, with this tool. (If you are new to GitHub, the [*“Introduction to Basic GitHub Contribution”*](https://iherman.github.io/misc-notes/docs/BasicGitHubContributionIntro) may be of help.)

Once you have your GitHub account name, **send this name to ivan@w3.org, or to one of the chairs**, who will add you to the Working Group’s “GitHub team” (in GitHub‘s jargon). That would give you the possibility of being asked personally to review or being assigned to issues, or editing the wiki pages.

You should also "link" your GitHub account to your W3C account; this can be done by going to the [relevant page](https://www.w3.org/users/myprofile/connectedaccounts) on your account. Doing so ensures that the various W3C specific tools can check your identity whether you use your W3C account or your GitHub account. As an example, if you do a Pull Request on one of the Recommendation track documents on GitHub, the system would know that you are bona fide Working Group member, which means that the possible IPR issues are properly handled by virtue of your institution’s Working Group membership.

## IRC

Meetings usually use [IRC](index#irc) as a tool for queue control and minute taking (and general chit-chat). **You should also send to ivan@w3.org your preferred IRC nickname (or nicknames, if you use several of those).** The goal is to improve the readability of the meeting minutes, so that third parties could also understand whose comments and remarks are in the minutes. Actually, in case you are already a seasoned GitHub user: the nicknames are stored (of course:-) in [file on GitHub](https://github.com/w3c/did-wg/blob/master/assets/nicknames.json), meaning that you can simply make a pull request providing with with your nickname(s) instead of a mail.

## Specifications in Progress

A list of the group’s specifications, including the publication status of each spec, can be found in the group’s [*PubStatus*](https://www.w3.org/2018/did-wg/PublStatus) document.

## New WG Member Introductions

Although it isn’t required, **new WG members are encouraged to send a short introductory e-mail to the WG's Public mail list** ([public-did-wg@w3.org](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-did-wg/)) or the group’s Member-only list ([member-did-wg@w3.org](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-did-wg/)). The introduction should include your area(s) of interest.

## Questions, Comments, Issues, etc.?

Please contact the group's Chairs and staff contacts (using the [group-did-wg-chairs@w3.org](mailto:group-did-wg-chairs@w3.org) list) — *at any time* — if you have any questions, issues, concerns, etc. about the Working Group.

## Resources

If you are unfamiliar with processes and roles within the Consortium; there is an [introduction course](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2014Apr/0026.html) available which takes little over an hour and a half to complete.
